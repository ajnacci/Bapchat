Once you have a model trained, it is time to
actually run the bot. There are a few things you
must do before the bot is ready to go.

1. Follow these steps to install Node.js and
set up the bot:

All we need is the bot's token, no coding
required. Do not share your token! Treat it like
a password!

Navigate to /bot/data_files and open tokens.json.
Replace the appropriate text with your token.

2. Navigate to /bot and open config.json. Enter
the name of your model (as indicated by its
directory name in the models directory) in the
appropriate place on line 3.

3. Open up the command line and run the following
one at a time:

npm install discord.js
npm install r-script
npm install express

4. Now you are ready to run your bot! This is the
only step you have to do to start your bot up
again in the future. Navigate to /bot on the
command line and run:

node index.js

After a moment, your bot should pop online. Have
fun!
