(replace statements in <these> with the appropriate text)

In this directory, run the following on the command line:

pip install transformers
cp ../processed_data/<data directory>/* .

The next step will run the generation of the model and place
it into the appropriate model folder in the bot directory.
If you have a more powerful machine, then you can replace
the model_name_or_path line with any of the following:
gpt2-medium, gpt2-large, gpt2-xl


!python ./run_language_modeling.py \
    --save_total_limit=3 \
    --output_dir=../../bot/models/<model name> \
    --model_type=gpt2 \
    --model_name_or_path=gpt2 \
    --do_train \
    --train_data_file=./train.txt \
    --do_eval \
    --eval_data_file=./val.txt \
    --block_size=100 \
    --overwrite_output_dir


Once this is complete, set the model name in config.json
in the bot directory and you're good to go. Note that this
process may take many hours depending on how much data you
have and whether or not you used a larger model (the
default model is the small gpt2).
